1) Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers using CTEs.

WITH top_countries AS (
    SELECT D.country
    FROM customer A
    JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    GROUP BY D.country
    ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10
),
top_cities AS (
    SELECT D.country, C.city
    FROM customer A
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    WHERE D.country IN (SELECT country FROM top_countries)
    GROUP BY D.country, C.city
    ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10
),
top_customers AS (
    SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city,
           SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
    FROM payment A
    INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
    INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
    WHERE (E.country, D.city) IN (SELECT country, city FROM top_cities)
    GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
    ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
    LIMIT 5
)

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average
FROM top_customers;

2) Find out how many of the top 5 customers above are based in each country using CTEs.

WITH top_countries AS (
    SELECT D.country
    FROM customer A
    JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    GROUP BY D.country
    ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10
),
top_cities AS (
    SELECT D.country, C.city
    FROM customer A
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    WHERE D.country IN (SELECT country FROM top_countries)
    GROUP BY D.country, C.city
    ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10
),
top_customers AS (
    SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city,
           SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
    FROM payment A
    INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
    INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
    WHERE (E.country, D.city) IN (SELECT country, city FROM top_cities)
    GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
    ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
    LIMIT 5
)

SELECT E.country,
       COUNT(DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT top_customers.customer_id) AS top_customers_count
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_customers ON top_customers.country = E.country
GROUP BY E.country
ORDER BY top_customers_count DESC;
